/**
 * Implements rank selection for populations of a user-specified constant size. The operator works
 * as follows:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>First, the population is sorted by their fitness, according to the comparator this
 *     selection operator was constructed with.</li>
 *     <li>Then, every individual is assigned a rank, starting at rank 1 for the worst
 *     individual and finishing with the highest rank for the best individual. Note that all
 *     individuals get a different rank, even if they have the same fitness value.</li>
 *     <li>Finally, the selection probability is linearly assigned to the individuals according
 *     to their rank.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Rank selection overcomes some issues of fitness-proportionate (roulette-wheel) selection
 * because it is unbiased whether the fittest candidate is, for example, 10 times fitter than the
 * next fittest or just 0.1 times fitter. Furthermore, rank selection provides a degree of control
 * over selective pressure that is not possible with fitness-proportionate selection.
 * <p>
 * In particular, users of this class can choose the extent to which selective pressure is exercised
 * by specifying the so called <em>selection bias</em>. For populations of size {@code N > 1} the
 * best individual is assigned rank {@code N} and the worst individual rank {@code 1}. With this,
 * the selection probability {@code p(i)} for an individual with rank {@code 1 <= i <= N} is
 * computed as follows:
 * <pre>{@code
 * p(i) = (2 - c + 2 * (c - 1) * (i - 1) / (N - 1)) / N
 * }</pre>
 * The parameter {@code 1 < c <= 2} is the user-specified selection bias. Here, {@code p(1) = (2 -
 * c) / N} is the probability of the worst individual to be selected, and {@code p(N) = c / N} the
 * probability of the best individual to be selected. Since all individuals were assigned a
 * different rank, the selection probability is different for every individual, even for these with
 * the same fitness value. Note that once the population size has been set, the rank based selection
 * operator cannot be applied to populations of different size as the computed probabilities would
 * no longer match.
 * <p>
 * By default, when no user-specified selection bias is given, the operator assumes a sane default
 * of {@code c = 2 * N / (N + 1)}. This way,
 * <pre>{@code
 * p(1) =     2 / (N * (N + 1)) = 1 / (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N)
 * p(i) = i * 2 / (N * (N + 1)) = i / (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N) = i * p(1)
 * p(N) = N * 2 / (N * (N + 1)) = 2 / (N + 1)
 * }</pre>
 * This means the best individual is {@code N} times as likely to be selected as the worst
 * individual, the second best individual {@code N - 1} times as likely as the worst, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Apart from that, the operator can be used in two modes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>In fast selection mode, the operator approximates the index {@code i} of the selected
 *     individual by transforming an equally distributed random variable {@code 0 <= r <= 1}:
 *     <pre>{@code
 *     i = floor(N * (c - Math.sqrt(c * c - 4.0 * (c - 1.0) * r)) / 2.0 / (c - 1.0));
 *     }</pre>
 *     This method has first been described been used by Whitley in the GENITOR algorithm (1989).
 *     The details are outlined in the literature. For selection biases between 1 and 2, it produces
 *     results almost identical to slow selection mode.</li>
 *     <li>In slow selection mode, the operator does not rely on approximations and has to fall back
 *     to exact (but slow) computations to determine the selection index.</li>
 * </ul>
 * @param <C> the type of chromosomes supported by this operator
