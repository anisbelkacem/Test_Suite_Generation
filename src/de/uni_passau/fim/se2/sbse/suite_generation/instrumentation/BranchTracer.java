/**
 * Facilitates the instrumentation of Java byte codes with the aim of tracing decision and root
 * branches in the control flow, and computing the distances for these branches in the instrumented
 * code.
 * <p>
 * The branch distance is a heuristic to evaluate how far a predicate (in our case as part of a
 * conditional jump instruction) is away from obtaining its opposite value. Naturally, the branch
 * distance is computed on the node of diversion in the control flow graph. Since the branching
 * distance is merely a heuristic, there can be different ways to define it. Commonly, we compute
 * the absolute difference between the operands of the predicate, and add some arbitrary but
 * positive constant value to it if desired. This approach guarantees that the branching distance is
 * never negative.
 * <p>
 * The Java Virtual Machine has distinct sets of instructions that conditionally branch on
 * comparisons with data of type {@code int} and reference types. Conditional branches on
 * comparisons between data of types {@code boolean}, {@code byte}, {@code char}, and {@code short}
 * are performed using {@code int} comparison instructions. A conditional branch on a comparison
 * between data of types {@code long}, {@code float}, or {@code double} is initiated using an
 * instruction that compares the data and produces an {@code int} result of the comparison (this is
 * similar in principle to the workings of methods like {@link Comparable#compareTo(Object)
 * compareTo()}). A subsequent {@code int} comparison instruction tests this result and effects the
 * conditional branch.
 * <p>
 * As a consequence, and without loss of generality, we can limit ourselves to the following kinds
 * of control transfer instructions:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>unary comparisons of an {@code int} with 0,</li>
 *     <li>binary comparisons of two arbitrary {@code int}s,</li>
 *     <li>unary comparisons of a reference with {@code null}, and</li>
 *     <li>binary comparisons of two arbitrary references.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This gives rise to the following definition of branch distance:
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Predicate</td><th>Result</th><th>Distance True</th><th>Distance False</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i == j}</td><td>{@code true} </td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code 1}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i == j}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code |i - j|}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i != j}</td><td>{@code true} </td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code |i - j|}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i != j}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code 1}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i < j}</td><td>{@code true} </td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code j - i}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i < j}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code i - j + 1}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i <= j}</td><td>{@code true}</td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code j - i + 1}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i <= j}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code i - j}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i > j}</td><td colspan="3">See Branch Distance for {@code j < i}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code i >= j}</td><td colspan="3">See Branch Distance for {@code j <= i}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code o == p}</td><td>{@code true} </td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code 1}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code o == p}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code 1}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code o != p}</td><td>{@code true} </td><td>{@code 0}</td><td>{@code 1}</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>{@code o != p}</td><td>{@code false}</td><td>{@code 1}</td><td>{@code 0}</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * where {@code i} and {@code j} are of type {@code int}, and {@code o} and {@code p} are
 * references.
 * <p>
 * Root branches are also handled by this class as they are of particular interest in the context
 * of automated test generation (esp. to handle methods without conditional branches). Therefore, we
 * also consider the root branch of every method for distance computation. To this, we define the
 * branch distance of a root branch as {@code 0} if the branch has been taken (i.e., the method has
 * been called), and {@code 1} otherwise.
 * <p>
 * It is desirable to keep the branch distance computation as lightweight as possible in order not
 * to burden the instrumented code with too much runtime overhead. For example, many expensive calls
 * to {@code Math.abs()} can be replaced with cheap subtractions (as has been done in the table
 * above) when it can be guaranteed that the result will always be non-negative. In addition, one
 * should avoid deeply nested calls and expensive recursive calls whenever possible. In general, one
 * has to carefully weigh which language features to use. If in doubt, one should construct a
 * minimum working example and examine the generated byte code using {@code javap -c} or similar
 * tools.
